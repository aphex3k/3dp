# Smart Phone Stand

Or smartphone stand or smart phonestand... It should fit most smartphones in portrait and landscape position standing upright or leaning back. It even works with smaller tablets.

This model was designed to be printed on one side and I highly recommend using a brim to increase the contact surface to the print bed for increased adhesion.

# iPad Wall Mount

We use an older iPad as controller for our Sonos sound system in the house. The tablet is mounted on the wall in a central spot of the house and near a charger so we can change the music whenever we feel like.

The model itself can not print on it's front or backside because of the notch overhang in that position. However, it can print without supports when standing on either of the long sides.

There should only be little infill needed.
